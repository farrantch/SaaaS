Sysadmin-As-A-Service - *Depricated*

This project was started as an attempt to replicate my job of a sysadmin .... but as a service.

And it worked! Pretty well I might say...

However, I eventually realized just how small that market was and how trivial it would be for AWS to crush me. If you're still looking for something similar, check out Skeddly - https://skeddly.com
